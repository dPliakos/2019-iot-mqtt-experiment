## Needs of a smart home

The needs of a smart home consist of four main topics:
- Objects humans interact everyday with them.
- Everyday object that can produce alerts.
- Home infrastructure that humans occasionally or never interact, but information about them
is more important.
- Human interaction with nature e.g. automated tasks like garden watering.


## Technical requirements
- Bidirectional communication (can send updates and receive orders).
- lightweight (can run on low power devices).
- fast (everyday tasks should be as convinient as possible).
- secure (personal information and security systems should be super safe. encryption is welcome).
- Reliable (security and infrastructure systems must work properly withought
  maintenance for long periods of time).
