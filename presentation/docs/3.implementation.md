## Topics and naming

The implementation will consist of 4 devices:
- 2 microcontrollers
- 2 ARM SoC

##### Description
The microcontrollers will be used in applications where there is need for
birerectional communication and interface with the real world.

The ARM SoCs will be used where we need cryptography or API Calls.


##### Examples
- Microcontrollers:
  - lights
  - temperature control devices
  - humidity control devices
  - infrastructure monitoring (electrical, water etc).
- ARM SoCs
  - Security alarm
  - The broker
  - API manager (e.g. weather or cron job runner).
